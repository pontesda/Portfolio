# C++ Coding Projects


### Thank you for visiting my portfolio! 

I am currently studying Computer Science at Fairleigh Dickinson University with a passion for software development.

My goal is to further expand software development and leadership skills in a professional environment that promotes teamwork through rigorous challenges.

Below you will find current projects I have created the C++ Language. 

The purpose of this page is to showcase my skills while collaborating with other developers around the world.

Cheers!

# Car Simulator

##### [View Code](https://github.com/pontesda/Portfolio/tree/master/carSimulator)

This program was a collaboration of my work and 3 other students at Fairliegh Dickinson University.
The classes you we designed are:
• The FuelGauge Class: This class simulates a fuel gauge. Its responsibilities are
– To know the car’s current amount of fuel, in gallons.
– To report the car’s current amount of fuel, in gallons.
– To be able to increment the amount of fuel by 1 gallon. This simulates putting
fuel in the car. (The car can hold a maximum of 15 gallons.)
– To be able to decrement the amount of fuel by 1 gallon, if the amount of fuel is
greater than 0 gallons. This simulates burning fuel as the car runs.
• The Odometer Class: This class simulates the car’s odometer. Its responsibilities
are:
– To know the car’s current mileage.
– To report the car’s current mileage.
– To be able to increment the current mileage by 1 mile. The maximum mileage the
odometer can store is 999,999 miles. When this amount is exceeded, the odometer
resets the current mileage to 0.
– To be able to work with a FuelGauge object. It should decrease the FuelGauge
object’s current amount of fuel by 1 gallon for every 24 miles traveled. (The car’s
fuel economy is 24 miles per gallon.)
We demonstrateed the classes by creating instances of each. 
We simulate filling the car up with fuel, 
and then run a loop that increments the odometer until the car runs out of fuel.
During each loop iteration, car’s current mileage and amount of fuel is printed.

# BUDGET ANALYSIS TOOL

##### [View Code](https://github.com/pontesda/Portfolio/blob/master/budget.cpp)

A program that creates and writes to a file named “Budget.txt”
The program asks the user to enter the amount that he or she has budgeted for a month.  
A loop then prompts the user to enter each of his or her expenses for the month and keep a running total.  
The program writes both the expense name and corresponding expense, along with how much he or she is over-budget or under-budget to the file.

# GEOMETRY CALCULATOR

##### [View Code](https://github.com/pontesda/Portfolio/blob/master/geometryCalculator.cpp)

A program  that displays the following menu:
Geometry Calculator
1.	Calculate the Area of a Circle
2.	Calculate the Area of a Rectangle
3.	Calculate the Area of a Triangle
4.	Quit

Includes input validation to make sure the user selects a valid menu option and does not input negative numbers for the measurements.

# SQUARE DISPLAY

##### [View Code](https://github.com/pontesda/Portfolio/blob/master/squareDisplay.cpp)

A program that asks the user for a positive integer no greater than 15. The program then displays a square on the screen using the character ‘X’. 
The number entered by the user will be the length of each side of the square.
This program ends after 4 attempts and uses proper data validation tools.

# SOFTWARE SALES

##### [View Code](https://github.com/pontesda/Portfolio/blob/master/softwareSales.cpp)

A software company sells a package that retails for $99. Quantity discounts are given at different rates.

This program asks for the number of units sold and computes the total cost of the purchase, displays the discount and determines how many more units are required to be bought to apply the next discount.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# SPECTRAL ANALYSIS

##### [View Code](https://github.com/pontesda/Portfolio/blob/master/spectralAnalysis.cpp)

If a scientist knows the wavelength of an electromagnetic wave, he or she can determine what type of radiation it is. 
This program asks for the wavelength of an electromagnetic wave in meters and then displays 
what that wave is.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# CELSIUS TO FAHRENHEIT

##### [View Code](https://github.com/pontesda/Portfolio/blob/master/farenheitCalculator.cpp)

A program that converts Celsius temperatures to Fahrenheit temperatures.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# ANGLE CALCULATOR

##### [View Code](https://github.com/pontesda/Portfolio/blob/master/angleCalculator.cpp)

A program that asks the user for an angle, entered in radians. The program then displays the sine, cosine, and tangent of the angle. The output is displayed in fixed-point notation, rounded to four decimal places of precision.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# COOKIE RECIPE CALCULATOR

##### [View Code](https://github.com/pontesda/Portfolio/blob/master/cookieRecipeCalculator.cpp)

The recipe makes 48 cookies with this amount of the ingredients. This program asks the user how many cookies he or she wants to make, and then displays the number of cups of each ingredient for the specified number of cookies.  The ingredients and amounts are in table form with 2 decimal points of precision and the decimal point always appearing.
